At the end of another drama-filled Premier League season, I thought I'd do a report card for the top six. There has been a lot to talk about this year, with City and United's spending, Salah's Messi-esque numbers, and Arsene Wenger's departure.


### Manchester City: A+

Pep Guardiola was called a lot of names at the beginning of the season. A chequebook manager, a rich-club-manager, a one trick pony, so on. All of them are true. But once you win the league with 19 points to spare, breaking English records along the way, playing scintillating football and making once-just-good players look world-class, turns out no one cares what names you are called anymore.

His investment in full backs paid off very handsomely, Ederson turned out to be a perfect replacement for Bravo, and his defence stepped it up along with KDB, Sane, Sterling and Silva. The expectations were to win trophies domestically and go far in the CL. He won the PL, the League Cup, and made a very good account of themselves in the CL. His only regret would be not having a plan B for games against high-press teams like Liverpool, who are the only ones who have been able to expose them this season.

They have a young, world-class squad with more reinforcements to come, and they play lovely football. It'll take something special to stop this City juggernaut next season.

### Manchester United: B-

Mourinho's second season is usually his strongest at any club. He spent a lot of money on acquiring Lukaku, Lindelof and Matic in the summer, and Sanchez later on in the January window. The expectation was to challenge for the title, and win some silverware domestically, while putting on a strong show in the CL.

United might have technically finished second, but we were in no means in contention for the title at any point of time, and not just because of City's dominance. They did well against the top 6, but dropped points against all relegated clubs, with inexplicable losses and draws to other 'lower' teams, too. They got knocked out of the League Cup early with an unexpectedly embarrassing loss, and then collapsed in the FA cup final and in the knockout against Sevilla in a similar manner - playing with no cohesive attacking plan, going for a safety first approach, and generally being terribly boring to watch.

While the second place position needs to be appreciated, especially with good results against other top teams with some lovely football on display in the earlier part of the season, it is not enough. United need to play better football more consistently, Mourinho's football legacyspeech in the wake of the Sevilla loss looks silly now (Trent Alexander Arnold, Andy Robertson and Loris Karius made it to a CL final this very year), and their attack needs improvement. United swapped an unimpressive Mourinho buy, Mkhi, for another flop-so-far in Sanchez, pushing an in form Martial/Rashford combo out of the door, and leading to reports of Martial wanting to leave for more game time.

Better than last season? Yes. Anywhere close to expectations? Nope. And worryingly, unlike other challengers, the solution 'buy better players' hasn't worked out for United.

### Tottenham Hotspur: A

No one expected Tottenham to win the league. Or the CL. The expectation was to challenge domestically and secure CL football again, while retaining their top players. And they have succeeded on all fronts.

Coming third in the PL this season, after a Pep juggernaut and a typically effective Mourinho squad, is an achievement. That goes without debate. While Chelsea lost out with internal politics and poor transfers, Liverpool struggled to manage CL and PL at the same time and Arsenal struggled in the limbo of Arsene Wenger's last season, Tottenham quietly continued what they started two seasons ago. Harry Kane turned up with the goals, Eriksen with the assists, Son stepped it up a notch, and depsite Alderweireld's saga, the defence was as good as earlier with Davinson Sanchez and Kieran Tripper coming of age this season. Pochettino has done a wonderful job of making the most of the resources and players he has. Spurs' wins against Dortmund,Juve and Madrid were probably the highlight of their season. The strongest team in London without a doubt.

However, while they had a strong squad with a cohesive plan, they could not improve on last season in terms of trophy counts. They still need to overcome their 'bottler' mentality, and deliver in the big moments. With the new stadium in place, another season of CL, and most top players on the verge of signing new contracts, things are looking very good for Spurs.

### Liverpool: A-

Yes, I think Spurs had a better season than Liverpool. Because getting to the CL final against fortuitous opposition with virtually a single man carrying the team all the way and then bottling it when he gets injured, is not different from Spurs beating Madrid and Dortmund in the group stages and Juve in their first leg, and then bottling it against Juve in the second leg.

Liverpool switched places with United in terms of beating the easier teams and losing against the big ones this season. Like a standard Klopp team, they played very good attacking football, like a standard Klopp team, had no plan B when plan A didn't work. They let Coutinho leave for a king's ransom, and the spunked it all on Virgil Van Dijk, who despite being a far better option than what they had before, makes basic defensive errors from time to time in big games. Despite Salah producing CR7/Mess-esque numbers, they couldn't capitalize on it to actually go on and win something, and their same defensive errors of errant full-backs and poor GKs plagued them in most of the key games this season. Klopp is improving his personnel, who in turn improve the system; Mo Salah has to be signing of the decade from Liverpool on the basis of this season alone. But Klopp has, for another season in a row, ignored to instruct his players on how to defend. Perhaps this will change next season, but we have heard that before. 

The positives, however, come from the CL run, and the way they dismantled City and Roma in the first legs of both games. When they get going, they are a very strong team. The front three of Mane, Firmino and Salah is perhaps the best attack in world football right now. Firmino's impressive season might have gone under the radar in the shadow of Salah's phenomenal season, but make no mistake, he is the best number nine since Messi. Klopp seems to have mastered the knack of building a team far greater than the sum of its components, and then leaving them half-tutored.

Early transfer business suggests they are strengthening in the righ places with Fabinho, but Liverpool always find a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every season. The key question going into next season seems to be - can Mo Salah do it all over again?

### Chelsea: C

Oh, what a collapse for the champions, and it is not the first time we've seen them crumble this way. It could have been a D if not for their FA cup win. The FA cup, if anything, was gross indictment of what they could have been in the league but chose not to be. Conte's spat with Costa was totally avoidable, and his treatment of new man up front Morata was far from ideal, destroying the Spaniard's confidence at every turn. Hazard carried them this season, like in most, but that was not enough to get them CL football. Conte's constant digs at the board means he'll probably be out next season, but he failed to achieve bare minimum this season.

Bakayoko, Morata, Drinkwater and Rudiger for Matic, Costa and young talents like Loftus Cheek, Batshuayi, Chalobah, Ake - Chelsea started with a terrible transfer window. Missing out on Lukaku for Morata wasn't good PR, either. The season continued on the bad note, with inexplicable losses and draws, a one-dimensional approach to football, poor attitude and mentality in most games, and collapsing time and again before Giroud brought some semblance of respect to their league position. The problems are deep rooted at Chelsea, with half hearted players who seem to give up when things don't go their way, a lack of control from the manager, poor transfers, expiring star player contracts, and reportedly no transfer fee to rectify things. Fabregas and Bakayoko need to be replaced, Hazard and Courtois may leave in the summer, and United are circling the sinking ship for a certain Brazilian Mourinho loved. Roman Abramovich himself is under investigation - days of the bankrolling the Premier League are gone, City and United have taken up that role.

Potential new boss Sarri has a huge problem on his hands, when he inherits this mess at Stamford Bridge. But make no mistake about Chelsea, when played right like in every alternate season, that squad can do great things as they have proved time and again in the past. 

### Arsenal: C-

Same old, same old.

Arsenal show promise, play great football, and then collapse halfway through the season, mathematically dropping out of the title race by January/February. Where have heard that before? Oh, did I add in the standard collapse when it comes to the mentally tough games? Signing Lacazette means nothing if you don't play him half the time (dropped, that too, for Danny Welbeck). Mkhitaryan and Aubameyang started linking up well for the latter half of the season, but for that they let their best player go to a rival once again. Getting kicked out of cups with arrogant and embarrassing performances is a usual for Wenger's teams, with the typical Xhaka brainfade moment, Welbeck's misses, Ramsey being out of position, and a key player always injured (is Wilshere even a key player anymore?) 

They dropped out of the Europa League in a predictable fashion, messed up against counter attacks from 'lesser teams' in predictable fashion, trusted blindly in the same flawed players in the same predictable fashion, who then messed up in key moments in a predictable fashion. Under Wenger, it was the same old script, the same old going through the motions. But this year, it came to an end - the only positive for Arsenal is that Wenger is gone now, and Emery can bring new ideas to the team, albeit with the same squad, since he hasn't been reported given a transfer budget - which was again predictably expected from miserly owner Kroenke.

This footballing equivalent of 'Groundhog Day' may have lost its lead protagonist, but I doubt the script will be any different under Unai Emery next season. Getting back into Champions League places might be a distant dream for the Gunners now.

At least there's Arsenal TV for the comedy. I'm not complaining.

Phew that took a long time to type out. So, what do you think? What does your report card for the top 6 look like?
