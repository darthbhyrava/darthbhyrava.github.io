Do not read this book if you haven't read any of Dahl's works already. 

Seriously, don't. You will not be able to appreicate his style, you will not be able to chuckle at a passage which strongly reminds you of his other tales, quite a few reference will go whizzing over your head and, most importantly, you will not be so attached to his memories as someone who's read his other works is. The book is a lot more fun - let me emphasise _more_ and _fun_ for you - when you're a Dahl regular. Go read some children's books first - try _The Twits, Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches_; then move on to his adult works - go for _Kiss, Kiss, Switch Bitch_ or _Someone Like You_. Then come back to this little masterpiece, and savour it like a delicious new flavour of candy.

Esio Trot, stel evom no.
