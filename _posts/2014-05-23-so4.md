summary: Can Louis Van Gaal turn our fortunes around?
---

The last time I blogged was in September. And boy, am I not glad I didn’t have to chronicle David Moyes’ fiasco of a tenure.

There are simply no words to describe the way the Manchester United powerhouse institution was ruthlessly dismantled in less than a year. The fall was so steep, it was almost cinematic. Seventh in the league, no European football, hammered by all the teams above them (bar Arsenal of course, poor old Wenger), no attacking intent, no tactical efficiency, and no spine. This wasn’t the team I was supporting an year ago.


Well, David Moyes is now gone, and we got someone with a backbone similar to Fergie to replace him. Louis Van Gaal is one eccentric character, his view of the universe is quite different. He has a reputation for developing young players, plays attacking football, is as good a disciplinarian as you will see, and has a reputation for brilliant tactics. On the flipside, well, he is on the wrong side of 60 and, frankly speaking, is mad. The future’s simply uncertain, again. Perhaps that’s exciting, in a way. Well, the transfer window opens soon, and we are rumoured to have a warchest in the waiting.

Let’s hope the next season is far better than this one. Over to you, Van Gaal.
