Some Old Notes

***

After surviving a late scare after a wonderful Erik Lamela volley, Liverpool have just walked off to a 2-1 win away at Tottenham, their fifth win in as many games in the 2018/19 season. They weren't the better side throughout the game - far from it, but just like in their 2-1 win against Leicester a couple of weeks ago, they were the better team when and where it counted. The likes of Milner, Wijnaldum, van Dijk and Robertson can now they can go back to their hotel rooms for a well deserved rest. Perhaps they'll switch on their TVs and hope that they can extend their lead at the top of the Premier League if Fulham manage something against the defending champions, Manchester City. 

As a Manchester United fan, there was nothing enjoyable in writing the previous few lines. There isn't much to enjoy when you look at your most bitter rivals battle it out for honours in the league and in the cups, while you sit at 10th in the table. And there isn't much to enjoy when your star players make headlines by flirting with other clubs, or when your club structure is in disarray, or when your expensive ensemble of sportsmen fizzle out in a damp squib game after game, or when your manager's style is more entertaining off the pitch than on it. As a United supporter, you just have to batten down the hatches and get ready for a bumpy ride. And hope that you won't wait for as long as Liverpool did (and are) before you win the league again. 

It gets a bit better (or worse, depending on your perspective) when you give in to the part of you that just loves a good story, irrespective of the jerseys involved. The Premier League is always a great spectacle, and this year, like the last, the big clubs like Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea _are_ playing lovely football. Throw in the ever increasing quality of the 'lower teams' like Fulham (who have a front three of Schurrle, Vietto and Mitrovic, with Jean Michael Seri behind them, and Sessgnon in reserve) or Watford (4 wins in 4, up against United), Wolves (how on earth did they get a player of Ruben Neves' quality?) - and as a neutral, it's just brilliant entertainment, a never ending soap opera that has it's viewers hooked on the to the drama and asking for more.

Will Unai Emery make a difference at Arsenal? Can we see the best of Ozil again? Is Richarlison the real deal at Everton? Is Marco Silva the next Mourinho after all? How good is Jamie Vardy when he doesn't have Mahrez feeding him? Is Iheanacho going to vindicate himself under Puel? How far along can Wilf Zaha pull the Eagles up the table, and how long will he stay there? Can new boys Cardiff make a mark for themselves? Can they survive the season? Why is Rafa Benitez still at Newcastle? What can he achieve for the faithful at St.James' Park? Ah, the drama will go on. Every time a question is answered, a new one will pop up in it's place.

And then there's the sheer love of football itself. The inexplicable joy you feel when you see the ball ripple the back of the net, and listen to the road of thousands of fans. Sitting thousands of miles away in different countries, different continents, football can unite us with the simplest of things. A nutmeg, a dribble. A dink past a defender, a deft drop of a shoulder. A half time equalizer, an extra time winner. A lung busting sprint, an arrogantly lazy flick. A last ditch tackle, a first time volley. A resolute will to doggedly defend, the unyielding drive to keep trying, the road of a home crowd, the taunts from the away fans, the slick movement of that one ball across a diagonal, down an alley, over a defence and under a wall. 

But I digress. The Premier League is a good saga, yes; football has been, is, and will remain lovely, yes; someone will win it and someone will no longer be in it, yes; and we're still United fans unable to digest the way we're lagging behind despite spending loads of money, watching our rivals get better and better while we are stuck in a quagmire of a musical chairs set up of managers, a flatter-to-deceive moments of turning-around-the-corner-and-this-could-be-it victories. 

We need to change things, and fast.

As many of you might know, Indian football captain Sunil Chhetri released a passionate video urging fans to come support the Indian team in numbers. His request touched a lot of hearts, with a record sell-out for India's next game, a 3-0 win over Kenya. This was Chhetri's 100th international game, and he celebrated it with a brace and an emotional thank you to the fans who turned up. 

This entire sequence of events, along with being a real feel-good story, should also raise more fundamental questions. Why does the Indian captain, the third highest active international goalscorer after Ronaldo and Messi, have to come plead a country of 1.3 billion people to come watch their national team play? Why does a country which forms 27% of Manchester United's fanbase need urging to watch their countrymen in the first place? 

I decided to start by looking at viewership numbers, with the biggies coming first. The official TV viewership of the Barclays Premier League is about [150 million](indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/ministry-lays-ground-for-top-english-premier-league-clubs-to-play-in-india-4778242/). La Liga's viewership is climbing at an exponential rate, currently at [40 million](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/la-ligas-reach-has-grown-400-in-india-rajesh-kaul/articleshow/61807040.cms). On top of the official numbers, [54% of millenials](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/25/illegal-streams-live-sports-sports-industry-group) watch football over illegal streaming websites, while one out of [every three](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40483486) Premier League fans uses these illegal streaming sites, too. All in all, it is safe to say that there at least 400 million Indians supporting, watching or following football in other nations. 

Now, some _desi_ numbers. The record high viewership of our very own ISL is also surprisingly encouraging, surging to [216 million](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/upward-trend-in-isl-viewership-9-million-more-than-last-year/articleshow/56295972.cms) by the end of the third season itself. In 2017, when India hosted the U-17 World Cup, FIFA estimated an audience of over [47 million](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/football-in-india-success-of-fifa-world-cup-isl-i-league-tussle/articleshow/62191117.cms). By these numbers, and by [reports](http://www.indiantelevision.com/television/tv-channels/sports/isl-piggybacks-on-epls-popularity-to-gain-viewership-171219) on the same, it seems that almost half the viewers of international football have turned to ISL, which is very encouraging for a competition in a nascent stage. 

these numbers not reflect on the national team viewership? Why can 200 million viewers all over the country not fill up 

It's time to remedy that. Indian football fans, we should start supporting Indian football. I'll start first, and make a solemn promise that I shall travel to Bangalore to watch the next Bengaluru FC game on 22nd of August, an inter-zonal AFC Cup semi-final against Altyn Asyr of Turkmenistan. (and then to at least one game of the group stages of the SAFF to watch the national team, depending on the location and date)

Which led to me personally realizing that though I watched the occasional Bengaluru FC game or an Indian football team qualifier, I maintained far more interest in the EPL than I did for the ISL or the national team. 

I need to do something about it.
