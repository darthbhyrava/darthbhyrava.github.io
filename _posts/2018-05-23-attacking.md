### To attack or not to attack, that is the question.

*** 

And if you're Jose Mourinho, your answer is never good enough. Mourinho has always been a results oriented coach, and that didn't change when he took over from Louis Van Gaal two seasons ago at Old Trafford. He'll get you the points and the trophies, but he'll do so by playing the percentages. Defensive, safety first, neutralize-the-opposition football. Manchester United, a club with a history of young players playing dazzling attacking football, made a compromise on their philosophies so they could climb back out of the pit they fell into when Sir Alex retired. And though Mourinho is better than Moyes (who dug the pit deeper) or Van Gaal (whose strategy of getting out involved creating ladders made of straws), he comes with his own baggage.

In his first season, Mourinho _did_ deliver a Europa League, an EFL cup and CL football for his next season. He got in top quality players like Pogba and Zlatan, and he had Old Trafford turn into a fortress. But now at the end of the 17/18 Premier League, he has gone trophyless, finishing second by 19 points, trailing Guardiola's phenomenal Manchester City side by 19 points in the table, and by decades of progress on the field. There is no cohesion in the play, Sanchez and Lukaku keep running into each other, and we lose to the so called 'smaller teams' . "They play _attacking_ football", ex-Red Devil Gary Neville complained of Manchester City during his punditry. "Why can't United do the same?""

Which brings us to the question - what _is_ attacking football? What is this mystic thing that has apparently been mastered by Guardiola, Klopp, Tuchel and Sarri? Why do both players and spectators hold it in high regard? I won't get into essays on different tactical nuances involved, mostly because I'm not aware of them to such high degree. Attacking football is a style of play which essentially aims to maximize the number of goals scored in a game, or involves a team as a whole always looking to score another goal. I will try and cover the basic tenets of what I consider to be attacking football, and how I'd like to see Manchester United play myself. 

### I. The Tempo

*** 

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width:600px;height:400px;" src="{{ 'assets/images/tempo.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="" /><br /></div>
The tempo of a game is basically the rate at which players move the ball around. When Chris Smalling gets the ball at his feet, looks around at each of his teammates, contemplates an existential crisis, and finally turns sideways and passes it across a whole ten yards to Phil Jones (and sometimes misses), we say he's playing at a slow tempo. Quick, one touch passes on the other hand increase the tempo of a game. Different players have different comfort zones when it comes to tempo, and part of the job of creating a successful attacking team is to learn how to make quick decisions, both consciously _and_ reflexively, and move the ball around quickly. In United's glory days of 2008, Ronaldo, Rooney, Tevez and Nani were brilliant at moving the ball very quickly as soon as they got it. In the modern era, few teams do it better than Klopp's Liverpool, with the entire team playing at a high tempo, with high speeds of transitions between defense and attack, players moving with energy and intent, and direct football breaking through defenses. I'd like to see United pick up the tempo of their games consistently, and not just when we're trailing by a goal or two. 

### II. Attacking Transitions

***
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/transition.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></div>


There are two phases of play for any team - when you _have_ the ball, and when you _don't have_ it.  Mourinho's teams have always been renowned for their defensive transition, the pace at which they fall back into positions when have lost the ball, and the defensive structure they maintain when they are trying to win it back. However, his attacking transition - the rate at which players get into attacking positions the moment they win the ball, is not as impressive. Too many a time, the midfielders will pander in possession and pass it sideways and backwards. Too many a time the forwards, devoid of instructions will get into the final third and lose the ball dribbling into a blind alley. By the time Matic wins the ball back, gives it to Pogba, and the latter finally decides whom to pass to, everyone in the opposition, their dogs, and their grandmothers have all gotten back into defensive positions. United need to have the intent and desire to score as soon as we get the ball. Our forwards need to provide movement, our midfielders should carry possession deeper, and our full backs overlap - so the endgame can be executed at a quick tempo. The idea is simple - the faster the transition, the faster you can exploit flaws in defensive structure or a lack of numbers defending against you the moment you get the ball. It helps, obviously, if you have quicky pacy players to help you transition, backed up by midfielders who can find a pass. Under the tutelage of Arsene Wenger, Arsenal are an example of a team who get caught by swift attacking transitions, time and time again. Catch hold of an Arsenal fan, and whisper 'Bayern Munich' into their ear - they'll tell you.

### III. Width

***
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width:750px;height:400px;" src="{{ 'assets/images/width.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></div>

Pep Guardiola's systems are the prime example of what width can do. Width is essentially a means of creating spaces in the opposition defence. You shift possession quickly from one side to another, you drag an entire defence out laterally across the pitch, and that always comes with a chance of leaving spaces forwards can run into. Attacking full backs, long-range passers of the ball to switch flanks, midfielders who make late runs into the box and wingers who can dribble into tight spaces once they have the ball are all key components to executing an attacking plan based on width. English football has traditionally championed width, where the wingers in a 4-4-2 cross it in for forwards to head home. With the influence of Spanish football, however (thank you, Cruyff), more focus is now placed on retaining possession while building width, and the full backs are the ones who cross, and the wingers the ones who dribble or cut in and shoot/cut back across goal. Now, I don't want Mourinho to do a Moyes and get 82 crosses into an empty box, but I do want to see better full backs than Young/Shaw/Valencia - someone who can maintain width and actually cross a ball. A right winger who can stay wide would also be great, since Mata occupies that space now and all he does is stay handsome, write blogs and run into Pogba and Sanchez.

### IV. Positioning and Movement

***

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/highline.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></div>

There's a phrase most football fans would be familiar with - a 'high backline'. An attacking philosophy should aim to provide as many numbers in attack as possible to help support the forwards (there's only so much an isolated Lukaku can do after winning a header) and a good way of doing that without compromising the midfield is to ~~clone N'Golo Kante~~ push up your defence higher up the pitch, i.e., maintain a high backline. This compresses the distance between defence, midfield and attack, and doesn't leave spaces vulnerable to a counter. Of course, a high backline means you're vulnerable to pacy forwards running onto throughballs behind your defence, but attacking always comes with its price. And this is a price I'd sometimes want Mourinho to pay. 

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width:750px;height:500px;" src="{{ 'assets/images/movment.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></div>

Positioning is just half the story. It's useless having a high backline, good midfielders carrying the ball, and players wide on each wing, if they don't provide the necessary _movement_. While trying to exploit a tight defence, forwards who can make clever runs both on and off the ball are invaluable. Not only do they make themselves available to well-timed through balls or lobbed passes through and over the defence, they can also drag their markers out of their positions leaving behind the space for another teammate to run into. Messi has displayed some of the best movement I've seen, he can dribble with the ball or run behind the defenders back drawing entire defenses in his wake, leaving the Suarezes and Rakitices ample space to run into. United are abysmal when it comes to movement. Sanchez, Martial, Rashford, Lukaku, Mata and Martial are all _very_ static when it comes to providing support or options. When Pogba has the ball, there's a bunch of United players just standing around waiting for the ball to come to their feet. And though Jesse Lingard's movement provides some hope that this might not be all Mourinho's instructions, I would like to see United address this aggressively. Again, the promotion of Kieran McKenna as assistant manager might remedy this; his U18 teams displayed remarkable attacking prowess en route to winning silverware under McKenna's supervision.

### V. Proactivity vs Reactivity

*** 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width:650px;height:400px;" src="{{ 'assets/images/proactive.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></div>

Whenever Mourinho claims he has played attacking football, whenever United have had 4-0 victories which the manager uses to defend himself, there is a key observation that needs to be made. United, when they do attack, reactively. We sit deep, wait for the opposition to make a mistake and lose the ball, and then break on the counter. In that sense, things haven't changes since Louis Van Gaal - in his days we used to keep the lion's share of possession, pass it around, waiting for a space to open up, for a mistake to happen. Waiting to react. The best attacking football I've seen has always been proactive, where players press the opposition defence to win the ball back as high up the pitch as possible, creating dangerous chances and taking risks in creativity. Simply put, Mourinho is a reactive manager, who will always take the most risk-averse option. I'm sick of that philosophy and would like to see United take the game to their opponents consistenty for a change. That is the United ethos - followed by Sir Matt Busby's legendary sides and followed by Sir Alex's treble and league winning teams. I hate Mourinho's reactive safety-first football, and would like to see games which bring me to my feet every time Sanchez runs into the box, with Pogba arriving late.

### VI. Attitude

***
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/attitude.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></div>

I left this for the last, because unlike the previous aspects, it is not possible to classify, quantify or categorize a team's attitude. A team's attitude is a result of many factors - the manager's personality, the mindset and mental fortitude of the players, the backing from the stands, the form, the history of the club, the game's tactics, players' individual moods and the team's goals. I believe it is possible to attack successfully if you don't have the tactics, but still have the attitude, because some of the tactics often come as intuitions to the players when they set their minds to attack. However, I don't think the vice versa is possible. United's attitude these days has been a stark representation of the manager's beliefs - we don't want to lose. I have no idea how, but I'd like the overall attitude of the team to change to 'score another goal, and then another'. We need to have the attitude to attack, like Liverpool do under Klopp, like City do under Guardiola, like Spurs do under Pochettino, and Arsenal did under Wenger. Perhaps it is time for players to step up as leaders and provide this inspiration, perhaps Kieran McKenna will provide it from the touchline. Mourinho himself ~~might change~~ will never budge on his safety-first approach, so this might be the hardest hurdle of them all.
