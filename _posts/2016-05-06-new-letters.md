Sometimes, I write letters. 

Simple, hand-written letters, three-folded and put into yellow envelopes to be given to people. I do that because spoken words are hurried and perishable and are lost in the wind, while written words can be treasured and carry a quaint silence of their own.

And sometimes, I write letters to myself. And since I spend more time at the keyboard and the screen than with a pen and a book these days, I would like to keep these letters stashed away in A Yellow Envelope - a space for my words, which is, funnily,  neither yellow nor an envelope.
