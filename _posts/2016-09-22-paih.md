summary:    I go through the Indian English poetry collection at the IIIT-H library, and decide to bring about changes.

The IIIT-Hyderabad library is as old as the college itself. We're doing a column on it at Ping this issue[^1], so I won't elaborate, but the fact that it has been well-organized and maintained for over 18 years now is very impressive, and the efficiency is reflected in its collections.

There should be no reason for the library of a college as technical and computer-science oriented as ours to have a good poetry collection, and that it why I was surprised to see the likes of Dylan Thomas, William Wordsworth, T.S.Eliot, Thomas Hardy and William Blake stacked up against each other in the lonely racks of the poetry section, back in first year. How many students before me had picked up those titles and flipped through the pages? How many had spent a rainy evening reading Shakespearean sonnets? I wish I knew.

There was one limited way to find out, and that was to look at the cards at the back of the books, and see who had issued the books before. There were a few names scribbled here and there, but they were far and few in between, and dated back to 2009 or earlier. One day, when I'm really bored, I'd like to go make a list, just for the heck of it.

What I was interested in, today, however, was poetry in Indian English. How many modern poets who wrote in IE did the library boast of? After lunch, I spent about two hours sifting through the racks, head tilted sideways to read the slanting titles, because there were too many books to be taken down in stacks and glanced through while sitting down on the floor.

I was pleasantly surprised, again, to see a good collection, and made a list:

 - _Dr.Rukmini Bhaya Nair_, the eminent linguist and poet who is currently a professor at IIT-Delhi[^2].
 - _Sri Sitakant Mahapatra_, an IAS officer and poet, who was awarded the Padma Vibhushan and Sahitya Akademi awards for his literature.
 - _Manohar Shetty_, the Goan poet, who has been a Homi Bhaba Fellow and a Sahitya Akademi Fellow.
 - _Leela Gandhi_, professor of English at Brown University (and the great-granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi)
 - _Vikram Seth_, arguably India's most popular writer and poet, today. 
 - The late _Dom Moraes_, who proably holds the unanimous honour of being the greatest Indian poet of his era.

 Not bad, is it? Apart from these poets, there were other collections of Indian Poetry in English:

 - "Both Sides of The Sky (Post -Independence Indian Poetry in English)", _Eunice de Souza_[^3]
 - "Early Indian Poetry in English: An Anthology 1829-1947", _Eunice de Souza_
 - "Illustrated History of Indian Literature in English", _Arvind Krisha Mehrotra_
 - "Indian English Women Poets", _Ansur Rahman_

However, this collection is quite limited, and leaves something lacking for the poetry enthusiasts. So I decided to make a list of poetry books I would personally like to see in college, and forwarded it to the Library Committee.

Now I need to compile a list of journals, and send a separate list for that, and hope for a favourable reply. I'll post an update as soon as I get one.
