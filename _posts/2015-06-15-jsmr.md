_“Why is there no more magic done in England?”_

This is the question which gives rise to the BBC’s beautifully made 7-episode show Jonathan Strange and Mr.Norrell, which is based on Susanna Clarke’s Man Booker Award longlisted and Hugo Award winning novel of the same name.

Set in a fictional 19th century England, it is a story of a magician and his inquisitive apprentice who set out to restore England’s lost magic to its former glory. If you were to juxtapose Jane Austen’s work with that of Charles Dickens’, and add a bit of C.S. Lewis, you would probably end up with what Susanna Clarke wrote. And it would be fair to say that the BBC have done a marvellous job in adapting prose to television.

Solitary scholar Gilbert Norrell, after spending a lifetime of hoarding and studying magical texts, decides to step out of the confines of his library to bring practical magic to the country’s service, soon finding respect and occupation in the Parliament by using his magic in the war against Napoleon. He is joined by the younger, more enthusiastic and radically inclined Jonathan Strange, who wishes to explore areas of magic forbidden by his tutor. But while these contrasting magicians are busy with their study and practice, the faery lord that Mr.Norrell summons to bring life to the dead plots to destroy them both and take over the country; and whispers of the Raven King, the man who brought magic to England centuries ago, are heard once again.
