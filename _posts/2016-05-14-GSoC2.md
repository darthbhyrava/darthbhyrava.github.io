The first stage of the project is called 'Community Bonding'[^1]. In essence, it is like a warm-up of sorts before you start working on the project. In Wikimedia's words - this phase is to 'familiarize oneself with the tools, mentors, and the community that will help the intern during the project'.

---

The __tool__ or 'object' in this case, for me, is Pywikibot itself. I cannot proceed without understanding what Pywikibot is - how the bots work and make their edits, how the code under pywikibot interacts with the core PHP, and what it exactly means to 'implement Pywikibot support for an extension (or a functionality) in MediaWiki. This is where studying last year's project - an implementation of pywkibot support for the Flow extension[^2], becomes important. 

The __mentors__ for this project the last time round were @Mattflaschen and @jayvdb - the latter is my mentor now, too. I need to interact with him to clear up doubts I have when I go through both pywikibot and flow. This will ensure I am in an appropriate position to proceed with coding for my project.

The __community__ in this case would be firstly the people involved directly with the code, namely [@jayvdb](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/jayvdb/) himself, [@Mattflaschen](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/Mattflaschen/), [@legoktm](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/Legoktm/) (my secondary mentor), [@Nemo-bis](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/Nemo_bis/), [@kaldari](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/kaldari/) (who is maintainer for the extension Thanks), [@valhallasw](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/valhallasw/), [@Mpaa](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/Mpaa/), [@Xqt](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/Xqt/). Secondly it would involve the GSoC org admins and volunteers - [@Sumit](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/Sumit/) (who was a GSoC intern himself), [@01tonythomas](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/01tonythomas/), [@Niharika](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/Niharika/) and [@Qgil](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/Qgil/). And lastly, it would involve the other GSoC interns who are involved in the project, including the very helpful [@AbdealiJK](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/AbdealiJK/) among others. 

The best way to get involved with the community is by interacting with what they're working on and then by asking questions, pointing out bugs, suggesting edits and so on. This can be possible only when I submit patches, go through documentation and read existing code.

I also need to create an organizational structure which will help modularize this project:

  * Creating a [project](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/view/1974/) for the same.
  * Create a [task](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T133667) for weekly reports where I can monitor progress via a series of objectives.
  * Creating a blog where I can articulate expectations and progress along with personal opinions. 
  * Creating subtasks on the project board to tackle at different stages of the project work.

### Community Bonding Evaluation

Wikimedia needs to evaluate the community bonding period for each student to ensure progress is being made. Hence we need to submit a CBE Report by the 22nd of May (official end of bonding period) stating progress. A sample report would look like [this](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T97728). The objectives for my CBE are:

  * Agree to a detailed plan with mentors.[^3]

  * Create Phabricator Project. _Done_

  * Record meetings with mentors:
       1. 15th May - IRC #gsoc-thanks
            * Work on changes [276752](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/276752/) and [283749](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/283749/) and submit new patches before 22:00 UTC on May 16th.
            * Establish `#gsoc-thanks` as medium of communication.
            * Establish that documentation work should publicly on the wiki.
            * Establish that queries on IRC (other than `#gsoc-thanks`) counts as being active.
  * Publish Bonding Report (Create a task for the same)

       _I'll put up a link to this blog post for the same._

       * Work Done _(Still to be done as of now)_
         * Setting up working environment.
         * Work on existing patches - the two mentioned in the first mentor meet first, and then [282616](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/282616/).
         * Go through documentation, clarifying doubts and editing wherever necessary. Private discussion in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kdmO82XLqDXKXq5qa3W9YgJrL6-wm7iiuTJfzQ-DXPA/edit?usp=sharing) google doc, and publicly on wiki. This would require me to learn wikitext.
         * Participating in code reviews for others.
         * Helping others get involved in the community.
         * Stay active and participate on IRC (ask doubts), mailing lists (send introductory mail on wikitech-l) and Phabricator.
         * Reporting and replicating bugs.
       * Lessons Learnt
       * Problems Faced and Solutions Found
       * Changes to original plan
       * MVP for project
       * Communication plan with mentor
         * Communicate with mentors over IRC
         * Weekly progress reports on the corresponding task.
         * Phabricator tasks for subtasks' discussion.
         * Patch submissions through Gerrit.
         * Documentation on Wiki

I personally believe that this period is more than just a series of things to do. WMF is a community, and you can read about an overview of what's happening in the big picture at many places.

[^1]: Read the formal definition [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Outreach_programs/Life_of_a_successful_project#Community_bonding_period)
[^2]: You can know more about Flow [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Flow) and have a look at the Flow proposal [here](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T93991).
[^3]: This would involve approving of the deliverables, refining them and agreeing to a final timeline for the stipulated work. This is the final stage of editing requirements. I need to maintain a record of the agreement, and post a link to it as well as the final plan (usually in the proposal itself).
