"Sit down Mourinho, Sit down Mourinho," chanted the Old Trafford faithful as Manchester United and Chelsea settled for a disappointing goal-less draw in David Moyes' first fixture at home. After all the hype that surrounded the meeting, the contest fizzled down to a cautious and non-clinical defensive display, with the most exciting moment being Mourinho frantically searching for his pen on the sidelines. Both the managers might believe that they’ve avoided an early hiccup, but Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool and City fans had the last laugh - instead of one rival dropping three points, both dropped two each.<br><br>

Mourinho started with a 4-6-0 formation. Quite obviously, he does not have too much faith in Demba Ba, Lukaku or Torres. Bereft of a world class striker, and with an array of No. 10s all cluttered into midfield, it was a disappointing starting eleven. But not a totally unexpected one, for such a defensive, ‘park-the-bus’ approach is quite characteristic of The Special One.  Mourinho, in fact, seemed to be quite happy with Chelsea squeezing out a draw. On another note, Juan Mata, who's not exactly the Special One's favourite, didn't feature in the match:  he won't feature for Chelsea at all, if one were to believe the transfer rumours.<br><br>

Performance-wise, for Chelsea, Oscar had a few shots on target; Lampard lost possession too easily in the first half; Schurrle didn’t impress up the field and Terry and Cahill kept van Persie quiet. The rest of the match was woefully unimaginative. You'd expect more from an encounter with the Blues, especially after their 1-0 victory over United in their last meeting at Old Trafford. Perhaps Mourinho is more focused on winning Chelsea's midweek match against Bayern Munich. That would explain why Ba, Torres, Lukaku and Mata weren't given their share of playing time.<br><br>

Yet, the Red Devils’ manager David Moyes might have a better reason to believe that he gained more than just one point from the draw, for the evening held a promise of things to come for Manchester United. The most notable and unexpected promise was that of Wayne Rooney, who put on a brilliant performance to remind the world of his worth.<br><br>

Moyes started with a 4-2-3-1 formation - Van Persie leading the offense; Welbeck and Valencia on the wings; Cleverley and Carrick in central midfield; and the unchanged defense consisting of Evra, Vidic, Ferdinand and Jones.  But the highlight of the starting eleven was hopeful Kagawa unexpectedly losing out on the No.10 position to Wayne Rooney. Rooney - the man who, after Bale, has been the biggest topic of the transfer season's rumours -  livened up proceedings throughout the match. He showed fierce intent, and kept at it throughout the whole match in an inspired display of energy, skill and sheer talent. He darted in and out of the midfield, had spirited runs further up the pitch, constantly threatened on the offense, notched up a string of beautiful passes to his credit, chased lost possession and won it back, and even had a few tries on goal - though all from outside the box.  If Welbeck had put in that cross in the penalty area - Rooney might have scored, too. He was a man possessed - and at the first opportunity he got, and he lost no time in proving why he is still the best striker in England. If he does stay (and in all probability he will) it bodes well for Moyes and his club.<br><br>

Giving Rooney a starting place was an encouraging statement of intent from the manager; the positive reception meted out by the fans another plus point. The way they cheered the apparent 'want-away' striker was heartwarming, with even the Special One stating at the end of the match -"This must be a very special club, because in every other club in the world, when a player wants to leave they don't support him."<br><br>

Had Terry and Cahill not put on a solid defensive display, and had Phil Jones, Welbeck and Valencia got their crosses into the danger area more often, it could have as well been a victory for Manchester United, and the perfect start to the season for David Moyes and Wayne Rooney. But the world of 'if's is infinite in football.<br><br>

United travel to Anfield for an away match on September 1st. Let's wait see what that encounter has to offer. For the moment, though, I can almost hear Alfred Pennyworth speaking, and do excuse me when I join the Old Trafford faithful for another chant:<br><br>

"Welcome home, Master Wayne."
