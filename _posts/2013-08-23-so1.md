Jose Mourinho's Chelsea will be back at Old Trafford on Monday for another historic meeting with Manchester United.<br><br>
United fans - let's face it. It won't be a walk in the park.

Moyes, back when he was with Everton, could never get the better of the Special One, with four losses and three draws to his credit. Yes - on Monday he'll be having the premier league champions' squad at his disposal, but it's not too superior a squad to the one Mourinho currently commands. The Blues may be lacking the incisive striker as of now, but you cannot deny that they have the edge in the midfield. Solid Lampard, young Oscar, and the talented Hazard may prove to be more than a match for Tom Cleverley and Michael Carrick. All throughout the transfer window, the Red Devils' fans anxiously awaited the new marquee midfield signing. There may be one soon, but there hasn't been one, yet. <br><br>
There were rumours, of course. More than a few names were linked with the club - Francesc Fabregas, Thiago Alcantara, Ilkay Gundogan, Yohan Cabaye, Luka Modric, Willian, Marouane Fellaini and even Bastian Schweinsteiger. And oh, the usual Cristiano-Ronaldo-returns-home gossip. Exciting rumours, but they remained just that – rumours. Manchester United have, so far, not succeeded in making any significant additions to the squad. Barcelona have rejected all the three bids United made for Francesc Fabregas, with the player himself stating in public that he was very happy at Camp Nou. There was a miserly bid made for the Everton duo of Marouane Fellaini and the talented Leighton Baines which, too, was rejected straightaway. Then came those ‘reports’ of players leaving. Mourinho was at it again - unsettling a 'confused' Rooney. Nani, some said, would be sold, now that Zaha had shown his potential; Valencia were linked with Chicarito. Again, there have been no major transfers away from the club, so far.<br><br>
Perhaps David Moyes' strategy is to wait till Real Madrid's expected $140 million mega-signing Gareth Bale arrives at the Bernebau, and then grab Di Maria or Modric. Or perhaps, when the last Fabregas bid fails, we'll sign Fellaini an hour before the window ends. Or perhaps there won't be any marquee signing at all, and Cleverley and Zaha will score 30 goals each this season and Adnan Januzaj will turn out to be the new David Beckham. Unlikely, but hey -it's football. You never know.<br><br>
Anyway - what we do know is that we'll have to depend on our offense again on Monday. Rooney remains an unlikely starter, irrespective of what Moyes might hint at in his press conferences. One year from now - Moyes might display his resolve by starting with Rooney on field, but this early in the season and his career - he'd want to play safe, and bank on certainty. In all probability, Van Persie and Welbeck will lead the attack, with Valencia, Cleverley, Carrick and Kagawa in the midfield. Giggs may get a look in, but he'll probably be a sub, and if not, then he'll certainly be subbed. Let us now pray that van Persie gets his usual quota, and hope that Welbeck's fine form may seal off the contest.<br><br>
And who knows? This early showdown with the Special One may as well turn out be Moyes' first stride out of Sir Alex's colossal shadow.
