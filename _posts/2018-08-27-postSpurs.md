After the 0-3 home loss to Tottenham Hotspurs, Jose Mourinho walked up to the Stretford End at Old Trafford, and started applauding the United fans. Outside the stadium, in the studios, pundits had already started their analysis on why The Special One had lost two out of the first three games at the start of the season. Journalists were sharpening their knives for the post-match press conferences, and media outlets and sports websites were finishing up their articles, keen to mention how this was United's worst start to a season in 25 years. Ed Woodward, the CEO who had reportedly vetoed Jose's pleas for better centre-backs in the summer, sat poker faced in the VIP stands. 

But Mourinho, picking up a United scarf which had landed at his feet, kept on clapping. All by himself in front of the 15,000 fans who stood up and applauded him back, chanting his name. After he had lost the transfer battle with his boss in the summer, he had lost two of his first three games. But he had not lost the support of the Old Trafford faithful.
