The World At War is a 1973 British documentary series about the events of World War II. Stretching across 26 episodes, it covers the key moments of the war, and the experiences of those who had gone through it. I came across it on IMDB while browsing around for TV shows to watch, and decided to give it a try.

I’m glad I did.

I cannot condense the 8 episodes I’ve watched so far into a single inspired blog post, but I’d like to talk about about one small part of the fourth episode, ‘Alone’, more specifically, about an event that lasted 76 days and left thousands dead and a city in ruins – the climax of the Battle of Britain, in which London was bombed to rubble. But more than the destruction, I’d like to talk about how the Londoners responded, for such a response had not been seen before.

In June 1940, Hitler, after conquering most of central Europe, had now turned to Britain. Operation Sea Lion was created, by which Germany would launch an amphibious and airborne invasion of Britain. But first, the German Air Force, the Luftwaffe, were asked to achieve air superiority over the British RAF. Though hopelessly outnumbered by the Luftwaffe, the RAF fought back bravely, largely assisted by a successful implementation of radar technology (The Dowding System) and the skill of their experienced pilots.However, they were almost exterminated, the ‘almost’ owing its existence to a German blunder.

The German strategy initially was to cripple the RAF, to bomb Britain’s airfields and nerve centers. Their bombers and fighters came in droves and poured destruction over the British airfields. July through September, the RAF were pushed onto their knees – their planes and pilots had been reduced to mere hundreds, their airfields almost all gone. By 6th September, invasion was considered imminent. Another week of such German offensive, and the RAF would have crumbled, and Operation Sea Lion would have been implemented.

However, on 7th September, 1940, the Germans erred. Hitler gave up the raids on airfields, and turned to England’s cities instead. Namely, London. Hitler was getting annoyed with the losses his Luftwaffe were suffering and, not knowing how close the RAF themselves were to defeat, changed his objective to ‘sapping the English morale’. And so began the bombing of London.

England’s greatest city was subjected to 57 consecutive nights of bombing (the Blitz), and over the course of 37 weeks, was subjected to 71 attacks, with more than 100 tonnes of explosives dropped on them with each attack. More than a million London houses were destroyed, and more than 20,000 London civilians perished in the Blitz. But they did not lose their morale, and they did not lose hope.

I have tried to put their resilience in words, it did not work. So I’ll let Quentin Reynolds do the job:

It is astonishing how the Londoners stayed ‘together’. How they cared for the fellow human in distress the same way they would for their loved ones. How calmly they went about their daily routines with death and destruction raining upon the. How they believed. 

In Churchill’s words, it truly was their ‘finest hour’.
