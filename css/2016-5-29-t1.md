I like the _idea_ of travelling. 

Now I am not sure whether I like the _action_ itself as much, not having travelled much, and not having left my country borders yet, but the _idea_, well, it's fascinating. Let me be clear, I'm not talking about planned trips where you stay in hotels, hire a guide to tour the place, have an itinerary off which you tick off the items one by one, take pictures to put up on Facebook/Instagram and then come home and tell people how much fun it was. No, when I say 'travelling', I mean the wandering type, where you just get your ass somewhere new, and then make it up as you go along within the time and money you have. I find the latter rather adventurous - there is something quite exciting about being in new beautiful places where you get to make quite a few choices spontaneously and go through new unexpected experiences. There is a sort of rebellious freedom attached to it, and considering that I spend the rest of my time attending lectures, working on coding assignments or in front of a laptop screen in general, it is a welcome break.
