As many of you might know, Indian football captain Sunil Chhetri released a passionate video urging fans to come support the Indian team in numbers. His request touched a lot of hearts, with a record sell-out for India's next game, a 3-0 win over Kenya. This was Chhetri's 100th international game, and he celebrated it with a brace and an emotional thank you to the fans who turned up. 

This entire sequence of events, along with being a real feel-good story, should also raise more fundamental questions. Why does the Indian captain, the third highest active international goalscorer after Ronaldo and Messi, have to come plead a country of 1.3 billion people to come watch their national team play? Why does a country which forms 27% of Manchester United's fanbase need urging to watch their countrymen in the first place? 

I decided to start by looking at viewership numbers, with the biggies coming first. The official TV viewership of the Barclays Premier League is about [150 million](indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/ministry-lays-ground-for-top-english-premier-league-clubs-to-play-in-india-4778242/). La Liga's viewership is climbing at an exponential rate, currently at [40 million](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/la-ligas-reach-has-grown-400-in-india-rajesh-kaul/articleshow/61807040.cms). On top of the official numbers, [54% of millenials](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/25/illegal-streams-live-sports-sports-industry-group) watch football over illegal streaming websites, while one out of [every three](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40483486) Premier League fans uses these illegal streaming sites, too. All in all, it is safe to say that there at least 400 million Indians supporting, watching or following football in other nations. 

Now, some _desi_ numbers. The record high viewership of our very own ISL is also surprisingly encouraging, surging to [216 million](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/upward-trend-in-isl-viewership-9-million-more-than-last-year/articleshow/56295972.cms) by the end of the third season itself. In 2017, when India hosted the U-17 World Cup, FIFA estimated an audience of over [47 million](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/football-in-india-success-of-fifa-world-cup-isl-i-league-tussle/articleshow/62191117.cms). By these numbers, and by [reports](http://www.indiantelevision.com/television/tv-channels/sports/isl-piggybacks-on-epls-popularity-to-gain-viewership-171219) on the same, it seems that almost half the viewers of international football have turned to ISL, which is very encouraging for a competition in a nascent stage. 

these numbers not reflect on the national team viewership? Why can 200 million viewers all over the country not fill up 

It's time to remedy that. Indian football fans, we should start supporting Indian football. I'll start first, and make a solemn promise that I shall travel to Bangalore to watch the next Bengaluru FC game on 22nd of August, an inter-zonal AFC Cup semi-final against Altyn Asyr of Turkmenistan. (and then to at least one game of the group stages of the SAFF to watch the national team, depending on the location and date)

Which led to me personally realizing that though I watched the occasional Bengaluru FC game or an Indian football team qualifier, I maintained far more interest in the EPL than I did for the ISL or the national team.
