summary:    Scrivener, by Literature and Latte, is a powerful content-management tool for writers. A 'first-draft' management tool, if you like. It's got a huge bunch of features, and it takes some getting used to. If you're writing a novel (I've started out on one), do use it. Here are some keyboard shortcuts which have been handy for me.

If you're on Windows or Mac, you should consider purchasing their licensed product [here](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php#). However, if you're on Linux, like me, you can go for Scrivener's unofficial beta version for Linux [here](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=20489&sid=a2d4f97fab014c3df4c0b5476344f673). I haven't really encountered any bugs so far, and it works like a charm.
