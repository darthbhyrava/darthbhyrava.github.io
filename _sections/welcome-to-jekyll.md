I like words. And talking to people. And writing to them. And reading from them. So if you wish to ping me regarding football or fantasy literature or a cool research idea or a poem you've written or read, please feel free to reach out to me via [mail](bhyravajjula@gmail.com). Or even better, write to me. Yes, a real handwritten letter inside an envelope with stamps on it. I usually reply quickly.
